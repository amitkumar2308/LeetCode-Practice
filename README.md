# LeetCode Practice â€“ Problem-Solving Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **LeetCode Practice Repository**!  
This repository is automatically synced with my LeetCode account â€“ every time I solve a problem, the solution is pushed here.  
It serves as a **living record of my problem-solving journey**, showcasing my growth in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Repo?
- To **demonstrate my consistency** in solving coding problems.
- To showcase **optimized solutions** in multiple languages (mostly C++/JavaScript/Python).
- To **track progress publicly** so recruiters and peers can see my journey.
